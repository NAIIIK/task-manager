# Task Manager

A Jira/Trello-style task management REST API built with Spring Boot. Users can create
projects, invite members with roles, manage tasks through a fixed workflow, and leave
comments - all secured with JWT authentication.

## Features

- **JWT authentication** - register/login, access + refresh tokens, refresh token
  rotation and revocation, logout.
- **Global roles** - every user is `USER` or `ADMIN`. Registration always creates a
  `USER`; `ADMIN` is not exposed through the API and only unlocks the management
  endpoints under `/actuator/**` (see [Environment variables](#environment-variables)
  / [Demo data](#demo-data-seed-migration) for how to get an admin locally).
- **Projects** - any registered user can create a project and automatically becomes
  its owner. Projects can be renamed/re-described and deleted (owner only, cascades
  to members, tasks and comments).
- **Role-based access per project** (not global):
  - `OWNER` - full control: update/delete the project, manage member roles, everything
    a `MANAGER` can do. Exactly one per project, set at creation, not transferable
    through the API.
  - `MANAGER` - create/update/delete tasks, add/remove members, moderate comments.
    Cannot delete the project or change anyone's role.
  - `MEMBER` - works on tasks, can self-assign to any task in the project.
- **Project membership management** - add an existing user by email with a role
  (`MANAGER`/`MEMBER` only), list members, change a member's role, remove a member
  (the owner can't be removed or re-roled through this endpoint).
- **Tasks** - fixed status workflow (`TO_DO` → `IN_PROGRESS` → `IN_CODE_REVIEW` →
  `DONE`), priority (`LOW`/`MEDIUM`/`HIGH`), optional due date and assignee (a
  `ProjectMember`, not a `User`). Full CRUD plus a dedicated self-assign endpoint;
  status can be changed by the assignee or by an `OWNER`/`MANAGER`.
- **Comments** on tasks - create, list, edit and delete, editable/deletable by the
  author or by an `OWNER`/`MANAGER` (moderation).
- **Interactive API docs** - OpenAPI 3 spec and Swagger UI generated automatically
  from the code (springdoc).
- **AOP-based logging** - every `@Service` method call is logged (arguments, return
  value, execution time, thrown exceptions). Sensitive data (passwords, tokens) is
  masked via custom `@Sensitive` / `@SensitiveResult` annotations, never printed in
  plain text.
- **Centralized log aggregation** - in Docker, application logs are shipped through
  an ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for searching and filtering.
- **Metrics & monitoring** - Actuator exposes Micrometer metrics in Prometheus
  format; Prometheus scrapes the app and Grafana visualizes JVM/HTTP/DB metrics
  through a pre-provisioned dashboard, see [Metrics &
  monitoring](#metrics--monitoring).
- **Global exception handling** via `@RestControllerAdvice` - consistent JSON error
  responses with status, message, timestamp, and request path.

## Project structure

The codebase is organized **feature-first** (package per feature - entity, repository,
service, controller, DTOs live together), not layer-first:

```

├── user/               user entity, global role
├── project/            projects
│   └── member/         project membership & roles, access guard
├── task/               tasks

```

## Getting started

### Run with Docker Compose (recommended)

Copy the environment template and adjust values if needed:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Then start everything:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

This starts:

| Service       | URL                   | Notes                                                   |
|---------------|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| app           | http://localhost:8080 | the API itself                                          |
| pgAdmin       | http://localhost:5050 | login `admin@taskmanager.com` / `admin`                 |
| Kibana        | http://localhost:5601 | log search UI, see [Logging](#logging--log-aggregation) |
| Elasticsearch | http://localhost:9200 | log storage, no auth in dev setup                       |
| Logstash      | tcp/5044 (internal)   | receives logs from Filebeat                             |
| Prometheus    | http://localhost:9090 | scrapes `/actuator/prometheus` every 15s                |
| Grafana       | http://localhost:3000 | login `admin` / `admin`, dashboard pre-provisioned      |
| PostgreSQL    | localhost:5432        | –                                                       |

### Run locally

Requires Java 21 and a running PostgreSQL instance matching
`src/main/resources/application.yaml` (or override via environment variables).

```bash
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

Running locally (no `docker` Spring profile active) skips the ELK/JSON logging setup
entirely - you get plain-text console + file logs, see
[Logging](#logging--log-aggregation).

### Environment variables

Defined in `.env` (copy from `.env.example`), consumed by `docker-compose.yaml`:

| Variable                   | Description                           | Value in `.env.example`  |
|----------------------------|---------------------------------------|--------------------------|
| `JWT_SECRET`               | HMAC signing secret for access tokens | insecure dev placeholder |
| `POSTGRES_USER`            | Database user                         | `taskmanager`            |
| `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`        | Database password                     | `taskmanager`            |
| `PGADMIN_DEFAULT_EMAIL`    | pgAdmin email                         | `admin@taskmanager.com`  |
| `PGADMIN_DEFAULT_PASSWORD` | pgAdmin password                      | `admin`                  |
| `GRAFANA_ADMIN_USER`       | Grafana user                          | `admin`                  |
| `GRAFANA_ADMIN_PASSWORD`   | Grafana password                      | `admin`                  |

### Demo data (seed migration)

`db/changelog/changes/007-seed-fake-data.yaml` (run automatically by Liquibase on
startup, in every environment) inserts a set of fake entities so there's something
to explore right after `docker compose up` without registering by hand:

- 1 admin user and 9 regular users (all `@taskmanager.local` emails)
- 3 projects, each with one `OWNER`, one or two `MANAGER`s and several `MEMBER`s
- ~15 tasks spread across all statuses/priorities, and a handful of comments

Login credentials for the seeded accounts:

| User                                                   | Password      | Global role |
|--------------------------------------------------------|---------------|-------------|
| `admin@taskmanager.local`                              | `admin`       | `ADMIN`     |
| everyone else (e.g. `alice.johnson@taskmanager.local`) | `password123` | `USER`      |

This is fixture data for local development/demos only.

## API overview

All endpoints except `/api/auth/**` require a valid access token
(`Authorization: Bearer <token>`).

### Interactive docs (Swagger)

Once the app is running, the full interactive API reference is available at:

- Swagger UI: `http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html`
- Raw OpenAPI 3 spec: `http://localhost:8080/v3/api-docs`

This is the source of truth for request/response shapes, validation rules, and
status codes - the tables below are a quick map, not the full contract.

### Auth - `/api/auth`

| Method | Path        | Description                             |

| PATCH  | `/api/tasks/{taskId}/status`      | Update task status (assignee, or `OWNER`/`MANAGER`)                                                                                                  |
| PATCH  | `/api/tasks/{taskId}`             | Partially update title/description/priority/assignee/due date (`OWNER`/`MANAGER`)                                                                    |

| PATCH  | `/{commentId}` | Edit a comment (author, or `OWNER`/`MANAGER` moderation)   |
| DELETE | `/{commentId}` | Delete a comment (author, or `OWNER`/`MANAGER` moderation) |

Note on assignees: `assigneeId` on a task always refers to a `ProjectMember` id (a
membership record), not a `User` id - and it must belong to that same project.

## Logging & log aggregation

Logging is configured in `logback-spring.xml` and behaves differently depending on
the active Spring profile:

- **Local / IDE run** (`docker` profile *not* active) - plain-text console output
  plus a rolling file at `${LOG_PATH}/task-manager.log`, rotated daily and when it
  exceeds 50 MB, keeping 14 days of history (capped at 1 GB total).
- **`docker` profile** - logs are written as structured **JSON** (via
  `logstash-logback-encoder`) to stdout only; no file is written inside the
  container, since container filesystems are ephemeral.

### Quick access to console logs

For a fast look without opening Kibana, just tail the container's stdout directly:

```bash
docker compose logs -f app
```

- `-f` (follow) streams new lines as they're written, similar to `tail -f`.
- Drop `-f` to print everything captured so far and exit.
- Add `--tail=100` to only show the last 100 lines before following:
  ```bash
  docker compose logs -f --tail=100 app
  ```
- When running locally (`./mvnw spring-boot:run`), logs go straight to your IDE/terminal
  console as usual - no extra command needed.

This is the quickest way to check whether the app started correctly or to watch a
single request go through. Use Kibana (below) instead when you need to search across
a longer time window or filter by fields like log level or logger name.

### ELK stack (Docker only)

When running via `docker compose`, container stdout is picked up and shipped
through an ELK pipeline so logs can be searched instead of grepped:

```
app (stdout, JSON) → Filebeat → Logstash → Elasticsearch → Kibana
```

- **Filebeat** autodiscovers the `taskmanager-app` container and tails its Docker
  log file.
- **Logstash** (`elk/logstash/pipeline/logstash.conf`) parses the JSON payload and
  writes it to Elasticsearch under a daily index, `taskmanager-app-YYYY.MM.dd`.
- **Kibana** (`http://localhost:5601`) is where you actually browse logs: create a
  data view with index pattern `taskmanager-app-*` and time field `@timestamp`
  under *Stack Management → Data Views*, then use *Discover* to search/filter.

This dev setup runs Elasticsearch/Kibana with security disabled
(`xpack.security.enabled: false`) - no login required.

On top of all this, `logging.LoggingAspect` wraps every `@Service` method and logs:

```
--> AuthService.login(***)
<-- AuthService.login [12 ms] returned ***
```

Arguments annotated with `@Sensitive` and results of methods annotated with
`@SensitiveResult` are masked (`***`) instead of being printed - this covers
passwords, access/refresh tokens, and any DTO or object that carries them
(`LoginRequest`, `RegisterRequest`, `RefreshRequest`, `AuthResponse`, raw JWT
strings, `CustomUserDetails`).

## Metrics & monitoring

Actuator + Micrometer expose application metrics in Prometheus text format at
`/actuator/prometheus` (unauthenticated, like `/actuator/health` - see
[Environment variables](#environment-variables)).

```
app (/actuator/prometheus) → Prometheus (scrape every 15s) → Grafana
```

- **Prometheus** (`http://localhost:9090`) scrapes the `app` service using the
  config in `prometheus/prometheus.yml`.
- **Grafana** (`http://localhost:3000`, login `admin`/`admin` by default) comes
  with the Prometheus datasource and a "Task Manager - App Metrics" dashboard
  already provisioned (`grafana/provisioning/`) - JVM memory/CPU/threads/GC, HTTP
  request rate/latency/error rate, and HikariCP connection pool usage, no manual
  setup required.

## Testing

```bash
./mvnw test
```

Unit tests (Mockito) cover service logic in isolation; integration tests
(Testcontainers + a real PostgreSQL container) exercise full request flows for auth,
projects, tasks, and comments.
